# Job Aboard - Microservices Training Project

## 📌 About the Project
**Job Aboard** is an **academic project** designed to help students **master microservices architecture** through a **30-hour hands-on training program**. The project focuses on building a **job listing management system** using a microservices approach.

## 🎯 Main Goal
The primary objective of this project is to provide students with:  
✅ A **practical understanding** of microservices concepts.  
✅ Experience in **service decomposition, inter-service communication, and scalability**.  
✅ Hands-on training with **modern tools and frameworks** used in microservices development.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts
Throughout the training, students will work with:
- **Spring Boot / Node.js** (for microservices implementation)
- **API Gateway & Service Discovery**
- **Message Brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)**
- **Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)**
- **Database Management (SQL/NoSQL)**
- **Security with Keycloak (Authentication & Authorization)**
- **Frontend with Angular Framework**

## 📅 Training Duration
**30 hours** of guided learning and project development.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
By the end of this training, students will be able to **design, develop, and deploy scalable and secure microservices applications**, preparing them for real-world software architecture challenges.

## 🎓 Acknowledgment
This project is part of the academic training provided by **ESPRIT School of Engineering**, aiming to equip students with industry-relevant skills in modern software development.
